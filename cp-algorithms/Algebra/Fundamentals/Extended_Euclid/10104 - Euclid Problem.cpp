// Problem : 

/*
From Euclid it is known that for any positive integers A and B there exist such integers X and Y that
AX + BY = D, where D is the greatest common divisor of A and B. The problem is to find for given
A and B corresponding X, Y and D.
Input
The input will consist of a set of lines with the integer numbers A and B, separated with space
(A, B < 1000000001).
Output
For each input line the output line should consist of three integers X, Y and D, separated with space.
If there are several such X and Y , you should output that pair for which |X| + |Y| is the minimal. If
there are several X and Y satisfying the minimal criteria, output the pair for which X â‰¤ Y .
Sample Input
4 6
17 17
Sample Output
-1 1 2
0 1 17
